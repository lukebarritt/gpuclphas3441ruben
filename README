If you are reading this, then you have successfully connected to github. 
This repository stores gpuclphas3441ruben.

As mentioned, github does not allow free private repositories. 
As such, this group project will have to operate publicly, 
only to be deleted at the end of the group project. 

Thanks to the public nature, please do not attract unnecessary 
attention. We cannot forcefully deal with it. 

As of the start of the project, please make sure you can edit 
the file TestHereFirst with your arbitrary content. 

Subsequently, we can keep a roadmap and other documentation 
here, along with the main files. The most important file is 
report.tex, which _is_ the LaTeX source of the final report. 
Please strive to keep this report.tex file in working order 
at all times --- it should be always possible to create the 
PDF of our report from this file. If anyone of you wish to 
check if it is working, or see how your changes look, you 
can feel free to contact me (Xiao) to compile it for you. 
Alternatively, for your own practise, you may want to run 
the program on report.tex yourself. Again, feel free to do 
so, as long as you do not clobber it. 

Finally, play around and get used to github. Enjoy!
