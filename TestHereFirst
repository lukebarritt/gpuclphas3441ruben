i can just add anything here then, i guess?
an u s this
Question: How do we start a blank tex file? How do we upload an example final report pdf? Is report.pdf automatically generated from report.tex? 
1) Github website does not allow you to create a file (stupid)
    the way to do something like that is to either ask me to 
    do it or you can download git to your computer. 
2) About the pdf, if you edit the report.tex, I will personally 
    generate the pdf by hand myself and upload it. So, do not 
    worry about the pdf. Because I have to do this by hand, it 
    will be as slow as I am available online to do it. Meow.
