\section*{Executive summary}
\subsection*{The Context}
  Why do we Verify?
We verify to assure confidence. We have a declaration, our verification methods, and our confidence. If we are too intrusive with our verification methods there is the threat of the spread of proliferation information which could in turn lead to a breakdown of the declaration agreements alongside an increased risk of mass devastation. If the verification methods employed are too feeble, the uncertainty in the confidence will be high and inspectors may fail to detect anomalous behaviour in the host’s disarmament activities.
This balance is known as the information barrier and it is spawn from the consideration of ratified treaties, the capabilities of the equipment and the feasibility of the procedure. The treaties outline what information should and shouldn’t be shared with the inspectors; the equipment and procedure are the technological or economic constraints.

\section{Introduction}

\section{Political Background}
\subsection{Treaties}

\subsection{Nick's Stuff}
The Verification process seeks to ensure consistency with declaration, 
and that disarmament has been achieved with a degree of irreversibility. 
The challenge facing proponents of Nuclear disarmament is to ensure that 
measures have been taken to safeguard against a Nuclear Weapon State 
attempting to cheat against the international agreements that have been 
put in place. The foundations for confidence are essentially built upon 
two key principles: Declaration and Verification. The interplay between 
the two is what establishes the iterative development towards Nuclear 
disarmament; because a more complete declaration can lead to greater 
confidence in the verification, and successful verification can lead to a 
decision to release a more complete declaration. However there is a third 
consideration that mediates between the two and also governs what should be 
done with the sensitive information that may emerge from the verification 
measurements -- the ``information barrier''; the foundations of which shall 
be discussed in section ??. 

What do we verify? -- Nick’s brief overview 
Nuclear warhead dismantlement starts with the removal from warheads from 
the deployment areas to the storage areas. The warheads are then transported 
to the dismantlement facilities where the ``Physics package'' is removed and 
then stored to await further dismantlement. Lastly plutonium and Highly 
Enriched Uranium re-emerge in an unclassified form ready for final disposition.

Annual report, Acton et al., p67]
Verification may take place at any point along this chain. A Nuclear Weapon 
State may declare numbers and types of weapons in storage sites for example, 
and it is the job of the inspector to confirm or refute this information. 
However inspectors do not enjoy the unrestricted right to freely examine the 
weapons; they must do so behind the veil of an information barrier because 
the act of inspection incurs the risk of spreading weapon information.

\subsubsection{Information barrier}
In support of several ratified and pending nuclear material control agreements, 
technical representatives from the US and Russia have recognised the necessity 
for assurances against the release of sensitive information to be put in place. 
The majority of these agreements involve storing nuclear materials and components 
from stockpile weapons within specially designed containers. 

Strategies for monitoring the agreements include measuring the neutron and gamma 
radiation signature to verify declared attributes of the plutonium or HEU. 
If these measurements are accurate enough to serve for this verification purpose, 
then they are accurate enough to contain information about the design of the 
component being monitored. Subsequently safeguards have been designed to prevent 
the disclosure of that information. Hardware, software and procedural measures 
containing the sensitive data will only present the relevant results required 
for verification.

[Progress in Gamma Ray Measurement Information Barriers for Nuclear Material 
Transparency Monitoring'', Wolford and White, Lawrence Livermore National 
Laboratory Library, 2000]
In the interest of transparent monitoring, inspectors may witness or perform 
restricted measurements on controlled items. The information barrier is designed 
to mitigate the intrusiveness of taking these measurements, and the proliferation 
knowledge it would pass on to the inspector. Wolford and White (2000) highlight 
three objectives that hardware, software, and human procedures should fulfill in 
order to be an effective information barrier:
``Prevent the unintended release of sensitive information during an inspection;
Display a simple but reliable and useful result to the inspector;
Allow checks on the integrity of the internal operations not visible during an inspection.''
However in applying the barrier, the person monitoring may lose the assurance 
that the internal operations proceeded as intended. Fortunately it can be shown 
that thoughtful design elements can help recover some of that lost assurance for 
the human operator.

\subsubsection{Design Elements}
An actual information barrier must be adapted to the measurement instrument it 
accompanies. However there are certain design elements that must be implemented 
no matter what type of measurement is being performed. The DOE-DOD information 
Barrier Working Group has provided guidance for 10 design bases which, when 
grouped into functional categories, fall into 3 top-level elements:
``(1) A barrier to conceal the sensitive information gathered in a measurement, 
and from which the physical attributes of an inspected item are derived. This 
consists of some combination of hardware, software, and human procedures, and 
must work in both directions, shielding unintended signals originating both 
outside and inside the measurement system.
(2) A simplified display that indicates clearly the selected results of the 
measurements as defined in the agreement, and nothing more. Accordingly, the 
display should be no more complex than is necessary to convey the result to the 
inspector.
(3) Enough autonomy to compensate for the lack of a human operator, both in 
monitoring the measurement and in safeguarding the data. The instrument must 
assure the reliability of its own measurements as well as protect the data 
resident during an inspection. In the event of failure or signs of tampering, 
this mechanisms should erase all traces of sensitive data from the instrument 
and halt the inspection.''

Requirements for Information Barriers, PNNL-13285, Pacific Northwest National 
Laboratory, Richland, WA, May 1999.]

How do we verify? -- Nick’s Pit stuffing 
`Pit-stuffing' was developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory to ensure that 
warheads that had been internally evaluated to be unsafe would not accidentally 
go off. Pit-Stuffing makes it possible to disable thousands of nuclear warheads, 
quickly, cheaply, and irreversibly; in a verifiable manner.

\begin{figure}[h!]

\end{figure}

[Pits.png Fig?? ] Figure 5.3. Storage arrangements for U.S. plutonium
warhead ``pits'' at the Pantex warhead dismantlement facility in Amarillo, 
Texas.217
[Global Fissile Material Report 2009: A Path to Nuclear Disarmament, IPFM 
Annual report, Acton et al., p71]
Modern implosion-type nuclear weapons have a ``pit'' which is a hollow sphere 
of plutonium or highly-enriched uranium, with a tiny tube through which the 
tritium is passed into the hollow sphere. If an appropriate material is fed in 
through this small tube until the inside of the pit is ‘stuffed’, and the 
plutonium can no longer be compressed enough to reach the critical mass to 
sustain a nuclear chain reaction as it would encounter the fill on the way.

At Los Alamos there had been discussions as to what would be the most suitable 
material. Aluminium powder and epoxy were suggested, however powder could be made 
to fall back out the tube, and organic material within the vicinity of plutonium 
could trigger chemical radiations and thus threaten the safety. 

The best considered option is to use bits of metal wire that are shaped so that 
they cannot be removed via the fill tube. 
If this were achieved the only way to make the weapon functional again would be 
to dismantle it, remove the pit and cut it open to take the wire out; then 
remanufacture the pit and reassemble the weapon. This would be an expensive 
process, especially compared to the minimal time it takes to fill the pit.
The physical act of stuffing the pit would about a minute; therefore a single 
inspection visit could be very productive, even if additional time is spent 
carrying out necessary safety procedures. 
Verifying that the pit had indeed been filled could be confirmed by incorporating 
micro-curie quantities of cobalt-60 in the stuffing wire. One set of gamma-ray 
counters aligned to view the pit from one side would give a few simultaneous 
counts with another gamma-ray detector orientated in a perpendicular direction. 
This is because cobalt-60 gives two simultaneous high-energy gamma rays. Such 
measurements could not be mimicked by gamma-ray sources that are not in the 
interior of the pit. 
[R. Garwin, Technologies and procedures for verifying warhead status and 
dismantlement, Transparency in Nuclear Warheads and Materials: The Political 
and Technical Dimensions edited by Nicholas Zarimpas, 2001]
However further measures may have to be taken against the host merely inserting 
minimal amounts of cobalt-60 without inserting the wire, or semi-inserting the 
wire with a view to remove it after the inspection. Also because pit-stuffing 
depends on certain details of warhead design and fabrication, it might not an 
approach that can be administered entirely blindly. 

The practicalities of this approach are encouraging for the cause of verified 
dismantlement because of the speed and minimal cost. The intrusiveness in 
principle could be low, if there was assurance that the wire had been inserted 
and could not be removed. The host could then be free to complete the 
dismantlement in privacy, removing the need for foreign verification during 
transportation which is currently a considerable expense.

After the dismantlement, the inspectors would return and be shown the canisters 
containing the stuffed pits. Again a gamma-ray spectrum could confirm that the 
containers enclosed hollow spheres of plutonium stuffed with wire. The inspector 
could be very confident that these were the same pits observed before the 
dismantlement as it would be very expensive and cumbersome to manufacture 
thousands of hollow plutonium spheres stuffed with wire.

[`Pit-Stuffing': How to Disable Thousands of Warheads and Easily Verify Their 
Dismantlement, Bunn, Federation of American Scientists Public Interest Report, 
volume 51, issue 2, pages 3-5, 1998]
This method would work for US warheads, but needs to be evaluated for Russian 
warheads that may have a different design. 
[R. Garwin, Technologies and procedures for verifying warhead status and 
dismantlement, Transparency in Nuclear Warheads and Materials: The Political 
and Technical Dimensions edited by Nicholas Zarimpas, 2001]
However pit-stuffing as a verification technique might not get it’s opportunity 
to be utilised because of the asymmetry between the sensitivity of classified 
items between Russia and the US. The years 2000-2002 saw dramatic global change, 
including the changing of American and Russian leaders. This meant that the 
enthusiasm for implementing Initiatives negotiated in the late 1990s was not 
sustained. The Russian Federation decided that it would melt its pits into 
2-kilogram balls and pack two plutonium balls into each specialized AT-400R 
container before submitting the material for U.S. or IAEA verification. The 
US and Japan provided AT-400R’s are the standard containers designed for 
Russia’s Mayak Fissile Material Storage facility. Russia maintained that the 
isotopic composition of its weapon plutonium in the 2-kg balls was classified.
[Global Fissile Material Report 2008, p. 70]

Although political decisions on declarations might stand in the way of 
pit-stuffing as a universal verification technique, further work* could be done 
to address some of the technical issues discussed as it could prove to be a 
useful tool to verify the US.

*(perhaps similar to the UK Norway Initiative Workshop on Nuclear Disarmament 
Verification 7-9 December 2011)
Example: Information Barrier for Gamma Ray Measurements
Gamma ray measurements can infer a lot of information about the object being 
measured including, constituents abundances, a lower bound for the masses, and 
the amount of intervening material. Also in a neutron-emitting source such as 
plutonium, the presence of other elements can be inferred from the evidence of 
activation products. Clearly much of this information lies outside that demanded 
of transparency agreements and fortunately a full spectrum is not required to 
derive the most useful attributes.

Programmers have an opportunity to protect most of the information. At LLNL 
software was created that used plutonium lines between 630 KeV and 670 KeV to 
compute a ratio of 240Pu to 239Pu which distinguishes weapon-grade plutonium 
from non-weapon grade. The tool, called Pu600, was adapted and enhanced for 
the requirements of the Trilateral Initiative and the FMTT program. Programmers 
at LLNL developed similar methods called Pu300 for determining the time since 
separation, and Pu900 for determining the amount of oxide present in a sample.

[Fig??: The gamma ray spectrum for a non-sensitive sample of plutonium 
containing several isotopes and decay products. The three narrow intervals 
of spectral lines are what is used in the attribute calculations Pu 300, 
Pu600 and Pu900.]

\subsubsection{Ideas for conclusion}
The United States has stated the need to protect the host's warhead design 
information overrules the need to provide confidence to the inspecting party 
regarding the accuracy and reproducibility of the measurements; in case an 
inspection is carried out in the absence of any agreement to share classified 
nuclear weapon design.

We could recommend that this shouldn't be the case for Non-Nuclear weapons 
states like Iran, where their proliferation information is obviously less 
developed  than that of the US or Russia.
Talking about info barrier.. The greatest potential for improvement in the 
transition from generic laboratory instrumentation to more special purpose 
inspection equipment, and the greatest challenge is to move away from stored 
programs and microprocessors towards pure hardware solutions.
The technology of information barriers is primitive compared to the technology 
of radiation detection and data reduction. Nevertheless, relatively simple 
systems such as those described above and in the references have provided 
sufficient assurance to sustain negotiations. The specific implementation of an 
information barrier system will depend on the requirements of the inspection 
regime. Nevertheless the three elements introduced here will always form its 
basis. More specific design influences include decisions about equipment origin 
and custody and the number and type of physical attributes to be collected. 
[Progress in Gamma Ray Measurement Information Barriers for Nuclear Material 
Transparency Monitoring'', Wolford and White, Lawrence Livermore National 
Laboratory Library, 2000]

The treaty should challenge the Host facility to demonstrate compliance: 
Change the emphasis of the verification procedure. Consider that a Nuclear 
Weapon State intends to cheat the disarmament agreements that are in place. 
``Winning'' if them is if they manage to fool the inspector. However if the 
onus were on host, it would be their duty to convince the inspector they are 
abiding by the agreements; for the cheat “winning” would be managing to convince 
the inspector. This approach addresses the underlying psychology between 
inspector and host facility more positively.

\section{Overall Process}
\subsection{Dismantlement}
Joint exercise between UK and Norway describes a possible dismantlement and 
verification process, conducted near Oslo in 2009. Cobalt 60 sample used to 
mimic physics package. A single nuclear weapon was moved into a dismantlement 
facility, where screwdrivers are used to open a side panel and remove the 
physics package. It is placed in a separate container. Everyone entering or 
leaving the dismantlement room is checked for radioactive material. Inspectors 
then confirm that radioactive material is present in the container. It is stored 
overnight in a sealed room with cctv. Seals used on items are low tech. The doors 
on the overnight storage room had a purple adhesive down the hinge which would 
change colour if disturbed. The adhesive strip itself is identifiable with a 
cluster of glitter suspended in transparent glue. On application and removal of 
the adhesive strip, this glue tag is photographed to check it has not been 
replaced, the exact configuration of suspended pieces of glitter would be near 
impossible to replicate. A simple technology like this seems to provide a reliable 
way of detecting tampering with a door or package seal. The following day the 
physics package would be moved to the ``hot cell'' where it would be dismantled. 
Using an ``information barrier'' device, the amount of material in the package can 
be measured without revealing the quantity to the inspectors. It gives a green 
light if the result was the same as the last measurement. Both countries 
independently developed and built their own detector. Using this method the 
package can be inspected at multiply points to insure no material has been 
siphoned off. Once the weapon has been dismantled the nuclear material is taken 
away for storage.[1]

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \includegraphics{pile01/ralph1.png}
\end{figure}

The magazine transparency system is a proposed method of storage to monitor and 
maintain the inventory of a ``magazine'', a storage area containing nuclear warheads 
or nuclear fissile materials during dismantlement verification operations. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \includegraphics{pile01/ralph2.png}
  \caption{A schematic of the Magazine Transparency System (MTS) showing the primary components.}
\end{figure}

A system like this has been demonstrated at the Pantex dismantlement facility in 
Texas. The weapon itself has only passive tags and seals placed upon it to eliminate 
problems associated with battery life. The MagTag blanket is simply a tarp containing 
permanent magnets in random orientations, so as to make it unique. The system has a 
high resolution magnetometer to detect changes in the position or characteristics of 
the blanket. The bar-code reader records the bar-code on the seal of each container 
when the magazine is emptied or filled. this data is stored on an integrated notebook 
computer which can transmit to a central monitoring station. The RF receiver transmits 
the unique RF tag number on each weapon/storage vessel to the notebook. Low light video 
cameras also send video straight to the notebook for processing. With all of this 
information, Gauss readings, video, RF tag etc... the notebook computer sends an ``all 
ok'' signal once every second assuming no anomalous activity is detected from any of the 
sensors. The notebook computer records no Non Proliferation treaty sensitive information. 
In the event of anomalous activity in an MTS during disarmament verification operations, 
the notebook is immediately given to the inspectors who can determine what kind of 
activity took place. [2]

Many weapons are dismantled without foreign verification by nuclear weapon states. 
This is done to reduce the size of the stockpile or to dispose of older outdated weapons. 
In the US, the national nuclear security administration (NNSA) is ``responsible for the 
management and security of the nation’s nuclear weapons, nuclear nonproliferation, and 
naval reactor programs'' [2] Part of this management is weapon dismantlement. design 
laboratory's work with production facilities to identify and mitigate any risks 
associated with dismantling a particular design of weapon. A plan is formulated to 
safely dismantle the weapon and it is taken to the Pantex Plant in Texas. The time 
reqired to dismantle a warhead ranges from ``a few days to a few weeks'' depending on 
the complexity of the design.[3] With the weapon dismantled, the high explosives and 
other non-nuclear materials are processed on site at Pantex and a few other facilities. 
The special nuclear materials are then dismantled at the Y-12 National Security Complex. 
[4] Here nuclear materials are down blended to reduce the enrichment and render the 
uranium useless for military application. Down blended uranium is then used to fuel 
nuclear power plants. According to the department of energy 10\% of the electricity 
used in the United States is produced using former Russian nuclear weapons.[5] Uranium 
``pits'' that are not down blended can be stored in a ``sealed insert'' system. Leak-tight 
stainless steal vessels are placed into steel storage over pack drums.

\subsubsection{Storage of Fissile materials/nuclear weapons}
Assuming confidence in the dismantlement of a warhead, for real progress to made storage 
is equally important. Nuclear weapon fissile materials need to be stored under 
international or bilateral monitoring, to prevent the construction of new weapons and 
also safeguard against theft.

\subsubsection{MPC+A, Material Protection Control and Accounting}
This program is an example of bilateral efforts to safely and securely store nuclear 
materials. Funded initially by the DOD and then by the DOE, its goal was to improve 
security on hundreds of buildings at 40 sites in Russia to prevent theft or loss of 
nuclear materials. 600 tons of material was found to be at ``risk''. in 2001, a report 
detailed that so far 81 buildings housing 81 tons of fissile material had received 
upgraded security systems. In 1998 the program was predicted to finish upgrading the 
storage facility's by 2020. [6]

\subsection{Chain of Custody}
Chain of custody refers to the system of routines used to provide a high confidence level that a
nuclear warhead will be delivered from its field deployment or storage location to the
dismantlement facility and that the recovered nuclear material will be monitored until its disposition
to make sure that it will not be reused [1]. Chain of custody includes the use of photography (X-ray
or gamma ray images, optical pictures), seals and tags, visual surveillance or video, warhead
authentication (detection and confirmation of nuclear or non-nuclear warhead) and information
processing (data transmission and relay, data compression, encryption and decryption etc.). There
are two categories of chain of custody: limited chain of custody of a specific dismantlement facility
and full range chain of custody with continuous knowledge of the disarmament process and the total
number of nuclear warheads. [2]

\subsubsection{Seals and Tags}
A tag is a unique characteristic (`fingerprint') of an object or container that is used to unambiguously
identify it. A seal or tamper-indicating device is a device or material that records unauthorised access
and leaves inerasable evidence behind. There are two categories of modern seals: passive and
active. Passive seals do not need electrical power to work and they are inexpensive but they can only
be used once. Active or dynamic seals require electrical power to work, either internally or
externally. They are more expensive than passive seals but they are typically reusable. [3]

Seals used in verification of nuclear disarmament need some unique attributes such as transparency
and negotiability. If the inspected facility provides and controls the seals, then the inspectors will be
suspicious and think that the seals have been tampered with. If the inspectors provide and control
the seals, then the inspected facility will worry about espionage devices such as microphones being
embedded in the seals. High tech electronic seals could be less comfortable to both parties due to
tampering, safety and espionage concerns. Also some weapon containers cannot accommodate
extra seals so the seals for nuclear disarmament will have to coexist with seals for safeguards and
internal security. [3]

Current technologies and technologies under development: [1]
Reflective Particle Tags (RPT): Reflective particles are mixed into glue that is applied to the
object being tagged. If the tag is illuminated by a point light source, particle reflections form a
unique pattern to that tag and incident angle. A tag reader records the pattern of individual
pictures using a camera and forms a set of fingerprints unique to that tag. The object can be
uniquely identified by reading its tag. [4]
Ultrasonic Intrinsic Tags (UIT): A sample is scanned ultrasonically and a hand-held scanner
collects sub-surface structure data. A computer performs the alignment and correlation
functions. These tags are resistant to surface changes and counterfeit.
Surface feature tags: A unique fingerprint of an item by examining its surface using scanning
electron microscopy, holographic interferometry and micro-videography.
Shrink-wrap seals: They consist of a plastic film that shrinks tightly around the safeguarded
object. A unique pattern is produced by multiple layers of geometrically patterned film and it’s
photographed for verification.
VACOSS fibre optic seal: The first IEAE electronic seal which consists of a loop of fibre optic cable
that is actively checked for integrity by the seal’s electronic system. Remote reading of the seal is
also possible. They are no longer supported by the manufacturer and are being replaced by the
EOSS seal which is more secure. [5]
Electronic Optical Sealing System (EOSS): It is intended for long duration surveillance with high
reliability. It uses a seal for enhanced authentication, smart power management system, tamper
indication and encryption. A tamper indicating enclosure protects the electronics and a 
microwave foil protects the complete housing against drilling. It can be coupled with surveillance
systems and can be remotely interrogated. [5]
Cobra seals: Consist of a loop of fibre optic cable and a polycarbonate sealing body. A unique
light pattern is created when a blade cuts the cable. The Cobra seal reader photographically
records this unique pattern and uses it for future comparison.
E-type cup wire loop seals: Consist of two metal cups which snap together and cover the
crimped ends of a wire loop. The inside of the cups is covered with melted solder and is
scratched to create a unique pattern that is recorded for future comparisons.
E-tag mechanical seals: Similar to E-type cup wire loop seals but also contain an electronic chip
that contains a unique identification number that can be verified without opening the seal.
Pressure-sensitive adhesive seals: Use pressure-sensitive adhesives to attach fragile labels to an
object. Unique reflective patterns are created by microscopic glass beads.
T-1 radio-frequency seals and tags: Consist of a fibre optic seal, case tamper switches, motion
detector and low and high temperature indicators.
Acoustic tags: Based on the unique resonant properties of an object when scanned using sound
waves of a specific frequency.
Radio-frequency (RF) tags: Emit a unique identification number and can be scanned using a
radio-frequency device.
VNIIEF smart bolts: A small reader is used to read the unique electrical properties and the digital
identification of the seal. The electrical properties of the bolt change if it’s unscrewed and that
indicates tampering.

\subsubsection{Vulnerability of seals}
All seals appear to be vulnerable to simple, rapid, low tech attacks. Attacking a seal means to trying
to gain access to whatever the seal is protecting without being detected. Defeating a seal means
opening the seal without being detected or leaving evidence of entry, or repairing any damage and
erasing evidence of entry, or replacing the entire seal or parts of it with counterfeits. The most
comprehensive seal vulnerability study has been undertaken by the Vulnerability Assessment Team
(VAT) at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. They analysed 94 different seals and defeated them for
a total of 132 defeats. All of the defeats were implemented using low tech attacks with tools and
supplies that in some cases can be easily carried in a person’s pockets. The time taken for successful
attacks varied from 3 seconds for several seals to 125 min for the most difficult seals. The mean time
taken to complete the 132 defeats was 4.3 min and the mean cost of the defeats was \$56. [6]

\subsubsection{Surveillance technologies}
Surveillance is another important element in the chain of custody and comprehensive surveillance
can also increase the security status of the monitored nuclear warheads. Comprehensive
surveillance provides a high confidence in the dismantlement process and establishes mutual trust
between the involved countries. Comprehensive surveillance combined with seals and tags can
constitute an in depth inspection system. Several technologies can be used for comprehensive
surveillance such as video monitoring, sensor monitoring, photograph comparing, intrusion
detection and satellite imaging. [2]

Video monitoring is widely used in international safeguards and domestic security and it plays an
important role in preventing illegal activities and proving treaty compliant activities. It is one of the
most widely used containment and surveillance techniques by the IAEA. [2] Modern digital imaging
used by the IAEA includes single camera digital surveillance units such as the All-in-one System
(ALIS), All-in-one Portable System (ALIP), Digital Single Camera Optical Surveillance System (DSOS)
and multi-camera digital surveillance systems such as the Server Digital Image Surveillance System
(SDIS) and the Digital Multi-camera Optical Surveillance System (DMOS). These systems were
developed to replace aging videotape based systems and the SDIS can be used for remote and
unattended operation. The General Advanced Review Station Software (GARS) was developed to
review all digital image surveillance records of the IAEA using a desktop computer. [7] The newest
system is the Next Generation of Surveillance System (NGSS) and it will be used in 2012. It is scalable
to any number of cameras, has solid state storage media, low power consumption, advanced
security features and is highly reliable under harsh environmental conditions. It can be configured as
a single all in one camera system or as a scalable multi-camera system. It supports various trigger
signals from electronic seals and sensors, high resolution and coloured images, remote monitoring
and picture taking rates of one image per second. Four different fields of view can be recorded
simultaneously by a single NGSS camera. [5]

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \includegraphics{pile01/CoC1.png}
  \caption{Picture of the Next Generation of Surveillance System (NGSS) with 24 cameras [5].}
\end{figure}

Sensor monitoring is another effective method used to track and authenticate nuclear warheads.
Various sensors such as motion/acceleration, weight, acoustic, radioactive, magnetic, thermal,
temperature/humidity, impact force sensitive and vibration sensors can be combined to monitor
nuclear warhead reduction and provide a high confidence. Most of these sensors are commercially
available and can be used in an integrated monitoring system which is easy to understand,
technically transparent and applicable by all parties. [2]

Photograph comparing is used to carefully examine recorded images of the objects being monitored
and detect tamper activities. Drawing random marks or images near the monitored object and then
photograph it from all angles can enhance the photograph comparing method. It can easily raise
disputes because it requires specific interpretation, either algorithmic or artificial, and the picture
taking process can be also affected by environmental elements so it is never used on its own. It is
often embedded into tamper-indicating monitoring methods and used as a complimentary
technique in nuclear disarmament. [2]

Intrusion detection is used in guarding nuclear warheads and uses microwave, capacity sensitive,
weight detection, infrared beam and motion/acceleration sensors to detect unauthorised access.
The technologies and intrusion detection methods are being continuously developed to increase the
efficiency and reliability of intrusion detection. [2]

Satellite imaging is used to detect change of large facilities or objects and requires advanced space
and electronic sensor technologies. It can integrate visual, multi-spectra, synthesized aperture radar
(SAR), thermal/infrared and other photographic technologies into a comprehensive system to
provide a meaning full picture of a specific area or object. [2]

\subsubsection{Vulnerability in chain of custody}
The Vulnerability Assessment Team (VAT) at the Los Alamos National Laboratory has extensively
researched issues associated with nuclear safeguards in the areas of transport security, intrusion
detection and vulnerability assessments.

\section{Detection Schemes}
\subsection{Passive Detection}

Nuclear warhead detectability is reliant upon 4 factors. These factors are: the warhead
design, the technique used for detection, the sensitivity of the detectors, and any material
between the warhead and detector that functions as a shield for the radiation. [1]

In order for detectors to accurately identify special nuclear material (SNM), they need to
be able to accurately isolate the true signal (for example, the gamma ray spectrum) from noise
(background radiation). That is, the detector needs to have a high signal-to-noise ratio. A
detector’s ability to obtain a true signal depends on its efficiency and spectral resolution.[2]

The efficiency of a detector is a measure of its ability to detect radiation and the rate at
which the detector is able to record data. [2][3]. SNM emits radiation in all directions; however
its intensity decreases with distance. Therefore, to improve efficiency, the detector should be
large or close to the SNM. It should also record data as fast as possible so as to reduce the time
spent waiting for the scan to take place. [2]

Spectral resolution describes the sharpness of peaks in a gamma ray spectrum. Since a
radioactive isotope releases radiation at certain energies, an ideal detector would record the
spectrum as vertical lines corresponding to those energies. However, detectors are not ideal, thus
the energy is recorded as a bell shaped curve. The closer the curve is to a vertical line, the more
beneficial the data is. [2]

The features of materials which allow them to be detected or identified are:
1. Atomic Number and Density: The atomic number (Z) is the number of protons in
the nucleus of the atom; it is unique to every element. Density is described as mass
per unit volume. Plutonium has an atomic number which is slightly higher than
uranium but its density varies from slightly more to slightly less than uranium [2].
2. Radioactivity: Atoms which are radioactive are unstable and give of different
types of radiation in order to become stable. The types of radiation used in nuclear
detection are gamma rays and neutrons [2]. Gamma ray spectra are unique to each
isotope, thus, it is fairly easy to determine the radiation that is emitted from an isotope.
3. Photon Opacity: The impenetrability of a material to a photon beam depends on
three things: the amount of material presented to the path of the beam, the energy of
the photons and the atomic number and density of the material. Gamma rays are able
to travel through low Z materials without any problems, however, high Z materials
absorb and deflect them. On the other hand, neutrons are able to pass easily through
high Z materials but are absorbed and scattered by low Z materials.

\subsubsection{Gamma Ray Detection}
Gamma rays are produced from within the nuclei of radioactive atoms. [3] To detect
gamma rays, a scintillation detector is used. A scintillation detector consists of a scintillator and
photomultiplier tube (PMT). A scintillator is a material which converts the energy deposited by
the gamma ray into optical photons (pulses of visible light). The optical photons are picked up by
the PMT which has two functions: conversion of the optical photons into an electrical signal and
amplification of the signal so that it can be measured. The PMT consists of a photocathode,
dynodes and an anode. The photocathode emits electrons when struck by the optical photons.
The electrons are attracted to the first dynode which amplifies the electrons into more electrons
that are then accelerated to the second dynode which produces even more electrons, and the
process continues until the electrons reach the anode. This is done so that a measurable current
pulse can be detected. The voltage of the current pulse is proportional to the number of low
energy photons which in turn is proportional to the energy of the gamma ray. Each pulse height
produced from the PMT is analysed by a device called a Multi-Channel Analyser (MCA). When
the MCA receives a voltage pulse, it sorts it into a bin depending on the energy and increases the
counts in that particular bin by one. A histogram representing the gamma ray spectrum of an
isotope is then drawn based on the information in the different bins. [2][3]

(FIGURE 1: PICTURE OF A SCINTILLATION DETECTOR)

An alternative detector which can be used to measure gamma rays is a semi-conductor
detector. A voltage is placed between two terminals on opposite sides of the semiconductor
crystal. [3] When a gamma ray strikes the crystal, its energy is given to the electron which is then
able to escape from the crystal. The electron is then attracted to the positive electrode. When
enough electrons are able to escape from the crystal, a current will flow. The electric current has
a voltage proportional to the energy of the gamma ray. The voltage is then sorted into a bin in the
same way as the scintillation detector. [2][3]

(FIGURE 2: PICTURE OF A NEUTRON DETECTOR)

\subsubsection{Neutron Detection}

Neutrons are uncharged particles. To detect neutrons, helium-3, an isotope of helium is a
good material to use. A tube consisting of helium-3 gas linked to a power supply is a
conventional neutron detector. The tube contains charged plated or wires that are positive and
negative. When a low energy neutron strikes the detector, it is absorbed by a helium-3 atom.
Energetic charged particles are then produced which lose their energy by knocking off other
helium-3 atoms. Positively charged particles are attracted to the negative plate and the electrons
are attracted to the positive plate. This movement causes a small electric current to be generated
which is then recorded. Neutron detection cannot be used to identify isotopes because they do
not have characteristic lines that correspond to discrete energies and they lose energy as they
interact with a low Z-material, thus their spectra is blurred. [3]

There are two techniques used for detection. These are passive and active detection.The
simplest detection method is passive detection which involves detecting any and all radiation
(gamma rays and neutrons) that are spontaneously emitted by the warhead. [1] The advantages of
passive detectors are they require less electrical output, they are not very expensive, they are
easy to build and do not add any additional health risks to workers. However, they are not
without their disadvantages. The major disadvantage is that the signal emitted from a nuclear
warhead needs to be greater than the background signal in order for it to be recognised. As a
result, there is a very good chance that passive detection systems can easily be fooled if the
radioactive material is shielded to prevent measureable amounts of radiation from reaching the
detector [4]

The passive methods that are used to detect the presence of plutonium depend on the
emission of both neutrons and gamma rays from its isotopes. The gamma rays emitted from the
plutonium isotope are of relatively low energy and attenuate greatly as they travel through the
warhead, thus gamma ray detection is not a reliable method to use. The best technique to use is
to look for neutrons emitted by the plutonium-240 (Pu-240) isotope. The fissile isotope of
plutonium is plutonium-239 (Pu-239); however, Pu-240 is active also [5]. This isotope
spontaneously fissions and typically emits about 106 neutrons per second with a characteristic
energy of 1 MeV [5]. In spite of the attenuation that these neutrons undergo as they travel
through the warhead, approximately 10\% emerge from the weapon and can be detected. It has
been estimated that a warhead containing 4kg of Pu-239 contaminated by 6\% of Pu-240 could
reliably be detected with a detector 1m from the warhead in only 1 second [5]. The most
important advantage of using this method is that a well-defined image of the warhead is not
observed because the neutrons are scattered repeatedly as they travel through the weapon to the
outside, thus only the grainiest geometrical information is revealed. [5][6]. A drawback of using
this method is that the emerging neutrons can be shielded without any difficulty. These factors
suggest that this neutron detection technique is best used in examinations in which nuclear
material is expected to be present, for example, to verify that the warheads earmarked to be
dismantled are indeed nuclear.

The passive detection of uranium can be carried out by measuring the high energy
gamma rays that are emitted from the uranium-238 (U-238) isotope. U-238 emits about 1MeV
hard gamma rays at the rate of about 7.5 per gram per second with 1MeV energy [5]. Depleted
uranium (almost all U-238) also emits gamma rays at this rate but HEU emits gammas at a rate
of 0.5 gammas per gram-second with 1Mev energy. The amount of depleted uranium and HEU
determines the amount of gamma rays escaping from the warhead. When a simple model of a
nuclear warhead is used to estimate this flux, the result is about 100 gamma rays per second
which is easily detectable [5]. The primary advantages of this technique are that the counting rate
(the number of gamma rays detected in a particular time) is generally high. One disadvantage of
this technique is that the radiation signature of HEU is relatively small; hence it quickly
attenuates [7]. A second disadvantage is that U-238 is used for other applications in which a high
Z material is essential, therefore there could be a lot of false positives (from U-238 used in
something that is not a nuclear weapon) if the method was used at questionable sites.

\subsubsection{Existing Detection Equipment}
The existing detection technologies available are:
1. Radiation Pagers: These are able to detect radiation at close distances. They are
lightweight and inexpensive, but are unable to ascertain the source emitting the radiation.
[2]
2. Radioactive isotope identification devices: These devices are able to identify
radioisotopes based on their gamma ray spectrum. These devices are mainly handheld but
heavy and delicate. They need to be cooled with liquid nitrogen or by mechanical means,
thus their usability in the field is limited. They have a relatively short range for detecting
radiation sources with low radioactivity, notably shielded HEU, making them unsuitable
as the primary method of screening cargo containers. [2]
3. Radiation Portal Monitors: Many of these devices use large sheets of plastic scintillator
material, such as polyvinyl toluene (PVT), to detect radiation coming from a vehicle.
However, PVT cannot identify the source of radiation. However, there are lots of items in
everyday trade that contain radioactive material. As a result, some produce many false
alarms, which may require considerable effort to resolve, delaying the flow of commerce.
Newer versions have some isotope identification capability. [2] They are primarily used
for security purposes at checkpoints and borders. [7]

\subsection{Active Detection}

\subsection{Muon Tomography}
\subsubsection{Cosmic Rays}
Cosmic rays are a flux of high energy particles that bombard the earth’s atmosphere. They are
produced in other parts of the universe and approximately 98\% of these particles are protons or
heavier nuclei and 2\% are electrons. These cosmic rays collide with air molecules and produce a
shower of particles that include protons, neutrons, electrons, positrons, photons, kaons and pions
(both neutral and charged). These particles interact by the nuclear and electromagnetic forces to
produce additional particles in a cascade process. Pions will interact with air molecules via the
strong force but some will spontaneously decay via the weak force into a muon plus a muon
neutrino or an anti-muon neutrino. [1]
\begin{equation} \pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \overline{\nu}_\mu \end{equation}
\begin{equation} \pi^- \rightarrow \mu^- + \nu_\mu \end{equation}

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \includegraphics{pile01/muon01.png}
  \caption{Cosmic ray cascade induced by a cosmic ray proton striking
an air molecule nucleus. [1]}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Muons}
Muons are the most abundant charged particles at sea level. They are produced high in the
atmosphere, typically \unit{15}{\kilo\metre} and lose about \unit{2}{\giga\electronvolt} before reaching the ground due to ionization. The
mean energy of muons at the ground is \unit{4}{\giga\electronvolt} [2]. They interact with matter via the weak and
electromagnetic forces but not with the strong force. They decay via the weak force into an electron
plus an electron neutrino or an anti-electron neutrino.
\begin{equation} \mu^- \rightarrow e^- + \overline{\nu}_e + \nu_\mu \end{equation}
\begin{equation} \mu^+ \rightarrow e^+ + \nu_e + \overline{\nu}_\mu \end{equation}

The muon flux at sea level is about \unit{1}{muon\usk\rpsquare{\centi\metre}\usk\reciprocal\minute} [3] or 
\unit{10000}{muons\usk\rpsquare\metre\usk\reciprocal\minute}. They are highly penetrating charged radiation. 
A typical cosmic ray muon of energy \unit{3}{\giga\electronvolt} can penetrate more than 
\unit{1000}{\gram\usk\rpsquare{\centi\metre}} (eg. 10 m of water). As muons pass through matter they either
scatter if they have high energy or are absorbed if they have low energy. The angle at which they
scatter depends on the atomic number Z (number of protons) of the material. As the atomic number
of the material increases, the scattering angle increases. In a layer \unit{10}{\centi\metre} thick, a 
\unit{3}{\giga\electronvolt} muon will scatter with an angle of \unit{2.3}{\milli\radian} in water, 
\unit{11}{\milli\radian} in iron and \unit{20}{\milli\radian} in lead. [4]

\subsubsection{Limitations of X-rays}
X-ray radiography is successful in many areas but has limitations. X-rays are unable to penetrate
dense objects that have a high atomic number. Multiple projections are needed in order to resolve a
three-dimensional structure using X-rays and they also pose health risks from radiation. In X-ray
radiography, absorption and scattering cause attenuation of the incident beam which determines
the intensity of an image pixel. The maximum mean free path of photons is about \unit{25}{\gram\usk\rpsquare{\centi\metre}} for all
materials which corresponds to \unit{2}{\centi\metre} of lead [4]. Even the most penetrating gamma rays are
attenuated by an e-folding in \unit{2}{\centi\metre} of lead. A very large incident dose of radiation is needed to
penetrate thicker objects and that is harmful for living organisms [5]. A different type of radiography
must be used for thicker objects and it must be based on the interaction of charged particles with
matter by multiple Coulomb scattering [4].

\subsubsection{Muon tomography concept}
Muon tomography is based on the multiple Coulomb scattering of muons as they pass through a
material. Radiographs of objects of any thickness can be produced by using multiple scattering.
Cosmic ray muons are passive and harmless radiation and allow radiograph of dense objects with no
artificial dose of radiation such as X-rays or gamma rays. The scattering of muons differs significantly
in three different groups of materials: low Z (water, plastic, concrete), medium Z (iron, copper) and
high Z (lead, tungsten, uranium) [6]. Each muon carries information about the objects it has
penetrated and the properties of these objects can be determined by measuring the scattering of
multiple muons. High Z objects can be detected amongst typical low Z and medium Z objects. [3]

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \includegraphics{pile01/muon02.png}
  \caption{Muon tomography concept. The grey tracks are the muons going through air and the black
tracks are the muons that penetrate a dense object. [3]}
  \label{muon02}
\end{figure}

The muon tomography concept is illustrated above in Figure~\ref{muon02}. The position and angle of incoming
muon tracks are provided by a set of two or more planes of muon detectors above and below the
object. These detectors only detect vertically oriented muons. Side detectors could be used to
detect horizontally oriented muons. The detectors above the object measure the position of incident
muons in two orthogonal coordinates. The scattering of the muons that pass through the material
depends on the type of the object. The detectors below the object measure the positions and angles
of the scattered muons. The scattering angle of each muon is calculated from the corresponding
incident and scattered measurements. The momentum is calculated from the slight scattering of
muons in the detectors themselves. [3]

\subsubsection{Simulations of muon tomography}
Simulations of muon tomography are very promising and results can be obtained within a very short
exposure time of approximately \unit{1}{\minute}. The GEANT4 Monte Carlo package is used for the simulations
because it implements a complete, accurate and validated model for multiple scattering. A detailed
GEANT4 simulation of a passenger van has been produced and reconstruction was achieved using
two different methods: mean and median. [3]

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \includegraphics{pile01/muon03.png}
  \caption{Illustration of major objects in a simulated passenger van using GEANT4. The red block in
the centre represents a \unit{10\times10\times10}{\cubic{\centi\metre}} solid piece of tungsten which is a high Z threat object. [3]}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[h!]
  \includegraphics{pile01/muon04.png}
  \caption{Reconstruction of \unit{1}{\minute} of simulation muon exposure of the passenger van using the
mean method. [3]}
  \label{muon04}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[h!]
  \includegraphics{pile01/muon05.png}
  \caption{Reconstruction of \unit{1}{\minute} of simulation muon exposure of the passenger van using the
median method. [3]}
  \label{muon05}
\end{figure}

The mean method of reconstruction shown on Figure~\ref{muon04} contains red spots scattered over the image.
The median method shown on Figure~\ref{muon05} does not contain these effects. The denser components of
the van (engine, battery, drive train) are shown as green (low Z) or blue (medium) but the high Z
threat object stands out as red. The median method is clearly better. [3]

A ray crossing algorithm has been developed that highlights locations where strongly scattered
muons cross paths. The basis of the ray crossing algorithm is the fact that a high Z object produces
many highly scattered rays which intersect in a small volume. A large depth of medium Z material
can also produce highly scattered rays but these rays will spread over a larger volume. The algorithm
was applied to a simulated scene of a \unit{6\times2.4\times2.4}{\cubic\metre} cargo container filled with \unit{12}{tons} of iron and
three \unit{9\times9\times12}{\cubic{\centi\metre}} uranium bricks were buried within the iron. A cosmic ray exposure of \unit{1}{\minute} was
simulated and the tracks were processed using the ray crossing algorithm. The results are shown
below on Figure~\ref{muon06}. [6]

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \includegraphics{pile01/muon06.png}
  \caption{Ray crossing algorithm reconstructions of \unit{1}{\minute} of simulated muon radiography of a
\unit{6\times2.4\times2.4}{\cubic\metre} cargo container filled with \unit{12}{tons} of iron and
three \unit{9\times9\times12}{\cubic{\centi\metre}} uranium bricks (a) and without the uranium bricks (b). [6]}
  \label{muon06}
\end{figure}

All three uranium bricks are clearly identified on Figure~\ref{muon06}a. The image without the uranium bricks is
empty of any signal as shown on Figure~\ref{muon06}b. The ray crossing algorithm shows great promise in
eliminating the scattering background. [6]

Other simulations were also produced using a Monte Carlo simulation code and the results are
shown below on Figure~\ref{muon07}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \includegraphics{pile01/muon07.png}
  \caption{Muon radiograph of a complex target in a volume of \unit{9\times3\times5.5}{\cubic\metre}. The first object (a) is a
large complex lead sculpture. The reconstructed image (b) shows much of the detail of the object
and it’s based on \unit{1}{\minute} of exposure. The second object (c) consists of a \unit{4\times2.4\times2.4}{\cubic\metre} container with
walls of thickness equivalent to \unit{3}{\milli\metre} of steel. There are 69 sheep made of water (shown in blue)
inside the container with a body size of \unit{60\times30\times40}{\cubic{\centi\metre}} and three uranium bricks of 
size \unit{9\times9\times12}{\cubic{\centi\metre}} (shown in black). The reconstructed image (d), based 
on \unit{1}{\minute} of exposure, shows that the 3 uranium bricks stand out. The colour intensity in the two reconstructed 
images corresponds to the significance of the signal. [5]}
  \label{muon07}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Experimental results of muon tomography}
There are a few prototype experimental muon tomography detectors that show excellent results
which are consistent with the simulations.
A small scale experimental detector system was developed in 2003 at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico [5]. A picture of the detector is shown below Figure~\ref{muon08}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \includegraphics{pile01/muon08.png}
  \caption{Picture of experimental apparatus at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in 2003. There
are four muon detectors labelled D1-D4 with a vertical spacing of \unit{27}{\centi\metre}. The detectors determine
the positions and angles of the muons in two orthogonal coordinates (X and Y). The test object (W)
was a tungsten cylinder of radius \unit{5.5}{\centi\metre} and height \unit{5.7}{\centi\metre}. A thick Lexan (L) plate of dimensions
\unit{35\times60\times1}{\cubic{\centi\metre}} and steel support beams (B) were used to support the test object. [5]}
  \label{muon08}
\end{figure}

Eight X and eight Y locations were measured for each muon by four ionizing radiation detectors
contained in the detector stack. The two detectors on top measure the incoming muon track while
the two detectors at the bottom measure the scattered track. Each delay line drift chamber detector
had an active area of \unit{60\times60}{\square{\centi\metre}}. The detector was calibrated with no test object to determine the
precision of the position measurement. A Windows based acquisition program was used to collect
the data. The reconstruction was approximated using the following simple technique. Multiple
scattered tracks were approximated to have only a single scattering event and the point of scatter
was located by extrapolating the incident and scattered rays. A maximum likelihood technique was
used to assign voxels (3D pixels) to each scattered muon. The reconstructed 3D image of the
tungsten test object is shown below on Figure~\ref{muon09}. [5]

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \includegraphics{pile01/muon09.png}
  \caption{Test object reconstruction using 100\,000 muons. A volumetric image of \unit{1\times1\times1}{\cubic{\centi\metre}} voxels
was reconstructed. The eight planes are horizontal slices near the middle of the volume, moving
from top to bottom. Both the tungsten cylinder and the steel support beams are clearly visible. [5]}
  \label{muon09}
\end{figure}

The data for the above image were collected over several hours because the detector was not fully
optimised. An optimised detector with 100\% tracking efficiency and large solid angle could acquire
the same data in approximately \unit{30}{\minute}. The test object and the test support beams can be clearly
resolved using this long run. Considerably shorter runs could be used for a simple yes/no detection. [5]

Another sub-scale prototype was built at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in 2006 called the
Large Muon Tracker (LMT) which is 20' tall. The design of this detector is very similar to the previous
detector. It consists of 6 top and 6 bottom planes of drift tube detectors for each X and Y dimensions
(24 planes in total) on a flexible frame. The top and bottom sections are separated by \unit{1.5}{\metre} to allow
a large sampling region. X and Y tracks are fitted separately to find the slope and intercept of each
dimension and combining them yields the 3D trajectory of the muon. A picture of LMT is shown
below on Figure~\ref{muon10}. [7]

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \includegraphics{pile01/muon10.png}
  \caption{The Large Muon Tracker (LMT) prototype at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in 2006.
The precise positions of muon tracks above and below the sampling region are determined by the
overlapping X and Y detector planes. The new redundant detector planes will be used improve the
tracking efficiency and quality. [7]}
  \label{muon10}
\end{figure}

The prototype of LMT was completed and tested in 2008. A simple reconstruction technique was
used to process the data. The sample volume of \unit{1.5\times1.5\times1.0}{\cubic\metre} was segmented into \unit{2\times2\times2}{\cubic{\centi\metre}}
voxels. The median scattering angle was calculated for all muons whose trajectories intersected a
voxel with an adjustable distance. The prototype was tested using a \unit{10\times10\times10}{\cubic{\centi\metre}} lead cube that
represented the threat object and it was placed in the LMT along with a car engine and transmission.
A photograph of the engine in the LMT is shown below on Figure~\ref{muon11}. [8]

\begin{figure}[h!]

  \caption{Photograph of a car engine in the LMT at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in 2008. [8]}
  \label{muon11}
\end{figure}

Data were collected for approximately \unit{160}{\minute} and have been analysed to reconstruct the images
shown below on Figure~\ref{muon12}. The mean scattering angle is plotted for all trajectories that pass through
each voxel. [8]

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \includegraphics{pile01/muon12.png}
  \caption{Mean scattering angle for a slice through the scene \unit{50}{\centi\metre} above the base plate. The left
image shows the car engine, the middle image shows the engine with the lead cube and the right
image shows the difference of the other two images. The lead block stands out dramatically. [8]}
  \label{muon12}
\end{figure}

Another muon tomography prototype is located at the INFN National Laboratories of Legnaro,
Padova, Italy. A volume of \unit{11}{\cubic\metre} can be inspected using the prototype which is ideal for cargo
inspection. A picture of the prototype is shown below on Figure~\ref{muon13}. [9]

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \includegraphics{pile01/muon13.png}
  \caption{Muon tomography system prototype located at the INFN National Laboratories of
Legnaro. [9]}
  \label{muon13}
\end{figure}

Two Muon Barrel drift chambers of dimensions \unit{300\times250\times29}{\cubic{\centi\metre}}, built for the CMS experiment at
CERN, were used for the experiment, separated by \unit{160}{\centi\metre}. A concrete and iron structure is
supporting the chambers. There are two additional drift chambers underneath the bottom detector
that will be used in the future as a momentum filter. The reconstruction procedure uses a List Mode
Iterative Algorithm (LMIA) that process events one at a time instead of grouping similar events
together. [9]

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \includegraphics{pile01/muon14.png}
  \caption{Test of the imaging capability of the prototype. The picture on the left shows the layout of
iron bricks forming the word INFN and the picture on the right shows the result of the data analysis
using the LMIA. The reconstructed image is very clear. [9]}
  \label{muon14}
\end{figure}

The experiment was repeated using two lead blocks of dimensions \unit{10\times10\times20}{\cubic{\centi\metre}} and two iron
blocks of dimensions \unit{10\times20\times20}{\cubic{\centi\metre}} placed on a support structure \unit{65}{\centi\metre} in the vertical direction. The
3D reconstruction of this layout is shown below on Figure~\ref{muon15}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \includegraphics{pile01/muon15.png}
  \caption{The left image is a sketch of the layout with the two lead and the two iron blocks. The
darker blocks are the lead blocks. The right image shows the 3D view of the reconstructed image
using the LMIA. [9]}
  \label{muon15}
\end{figure}

The position of the blocks is reproduced correctly but there is finite spatial resolution in the
reconstruction especially in the vertical direction. The reconstructed scattering density of the lead
blocks is greater than that of the iron blocks. It’s straightforward to discriminate low Z or medium Z
materials from high Z materials using this method. The problem with this method is that
discrimination between high Z materials denser than iron is more difficult because of the non-
linearity in the reconstructed scattering density. This means that the muon momentum has to be
measured as well to allow a better material recognition and increase the statistical precision of the
density measurement. [9]

\subsubsection{Applications of muon tomography}
Muon tomography could be used to protect the rail network from terrorism. The idea is to equip
train stations with large muon detectors above and below. Density images can be produced very fast
in a time scale of minutes. High density objects such as nail bombs and fissile materials will be easily
identified. [10]

It could also be used as a detection method of nuclear devices or material in vehicles and containers.
An automobile sized counting station could be used to scan vehicles at border crossing. This would
allow examination of every vehicle and shipping container crossing a border. It will require enough
detectors to handle the traffic at the borders. The total traffic crossing the US -- Mexico and the US --
Canada borders in 2008 was \(1.3\times10^8\) vehicles. Assuming a single muon tomography detector could
analyse a vehicle within \unit{1}{\minute} and operates for 12 hours per day, then 500 detectors would be
needed to handle the entire border crossing traffic. This would cost a total of 1.5 to 2 billion dollars
but its negligible compared to the consequences of the detonation of a nuclear bomb. A picture of
how it could be implemented at a border crossing is shown below on Figure~\ref{muon16}. [8]

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \includegraphics{pile01/muon16.png}
  \caption{Schematic view of how a counting station might look. Vehicles would have to stop for
approximately 20 seconds for the scan. [8]}
  \label{muon16}
\end{figure}

Both methods could be used for nuclear dismantlement verification. The vehicle transporting the
bomb for disarmament could be scanned at several stations during its journey to the dismantlement
facilities. A single muon tomography detector at the dismantlement facility could be used to verify a
small quantity of nuclear bombs. If there is a large number of bombs queued for verification then
the idea of the train stations could be used. A room with muon detectors on the flood and the ceiling
could be used to scan all of them at the same time.
