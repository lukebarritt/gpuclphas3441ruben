\section{Sample Section}
Here is a sample statement, of which I shall 
include the most well known equation of all. 
Indeed, the irony is that this equation is 
intimately related to our group project. 
\[ 
E = \gamma m_0 c^2
\]

\section{Executive summary}
\section{The Context}
  Why do we Verify?
We verify to assure confidence. We have a declaration, our verification methods, and our confidence. If we are too intrusive with our verification methods there is the threat of the spread of proliferation information which could in turn lead to a breakdown of the declaration agreements alongside an increased risk of mass devastation. If the verification methods employed are too feeble, the uncertainty in the confidence will be high and inspectors may fail to detect anomalous behaviour in the host’s disarmament activities.
This balance is known as the information barrier and it is spawn from the consideration of ratified treaties, the capabilities of the equipment and the feasibility of the procedure. The treaties outline what information should and shouldn’t be shared with the inspectors; the equipment and procedure are the technological or economic constraints.
*A chart of time, treaty and declaration information or disarmament rates, there should be an inflection at 2002 *
